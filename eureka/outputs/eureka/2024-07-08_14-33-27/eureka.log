The policy will be trained in simulation and deployed in the real world, so the policy should be as steady and stable as possible with minimal action rate. Specifically, as it's running, the torso should remain near a z position of 0.34, and the orientation should be perpendicular to gravity. Also, the legs should move smoothly and avoid the DOF limits.

Here is a reward function designed to make the go1 quadruped run forward with a target velocity of exactly 2.0 m/s in the positive x direction of the global coordinate frame, while maintaining stability, minimizing action rate, and avoiding DOF limits:

```python
def compute_reward(self):
    env = self.env  # Do not skip this line. Afterwards, use env.{parameter_name} to access parameters of the environment.
    
    # Calculate the velocity reward based on how close the robot's base linear velocity in the x direction is to 2.0 m/s
    target_velocity = 2.0
    vel_error = torch.abs(env.base_lin_vel[:, 0] - target_velocity)
    velocity_reward = 1.0 - vel_error / target_velocity

    # Reward for maintaining torso height near 0.34 meters
    target_height = 0.34
    height_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 2] - target_height)
    height_reward = 1.0 - height_error / target_height

    # Reward for maintaining orientation perpendicular to gravity
    orientation_reward = -torch.norm(env.projected_gravity[:, :2], dim=1)  # Should be close to zero

    # Penalty for high action rates (difference between consecutive actions)
    action_rate_penalty = torch.sum(torch.abs(env.actions - env.last_actions), dim=1)

    # Penalty for DOF limit violations
    dof_pos_penalty = torch.sum(torch.abs(env.dof_pos - env.default_dof_pos) > (env.dof_pos_limits[:, 1] - env.dof_pos_limits[:, 0]) * 0.5, dim=1).float()

    # Penalty for high torques to encourage energy efficiency
    torque_penalty = torch.sum(env.torques ** 2, dim=1)
    
    # Combine all reward terms
    reward = (
        2.0 * velocity_reward
        + 0.5 * height_reward
        + 1.0 * orientation_reward
        - 0.01 * action_rate_penalty
        - 0.1 * dof_pos_penalty
        - 0.001 * torque_penalty
    )

    # Returning individual reward components for logging/debugging purposes
    reward_components = {
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward,
        "height_reward": height_reward,
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,

        "dof_pos_penalty": dof_pos_penalty,

    }

    return reward, reward_components
```

This reward function encourages the quadruped to run forward with a target velocity, keep its torso steady and stable, maintain an appropriate height, and avoid excessive joint movements and high action rates. Each component of the reward function contributes to the overall stability and efficiency of the robot, which is crucial for deploying the policy in the real world.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward (tensor with reward per environment)
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component (tensor with reward component per environment)
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (2) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

To address the discrepancies and observations from the policy feedback, we will refine the reward function by focusing on the following points:

1. **Task Score and Episode Length**: The task score has an upward trend but the episode length shows a wide range. We need to stabilize the reward function.
2. **Action Rate Penalty**: The action rate penalty is significantly high. Reducing its weight in the total reward function should help the policy.
3. **DOF Position Penalty**: This component seems to be functioning well, but we can re-adjust its weighting considering the overall impact.
4. **Height Reward**: This component works effectively but its scale can be slightly increased to ensure stability.
5. **Orientation Reward**: The negative values indicate that the component is working but needs a different scaling or structure. 
6. **Torque Penalty**: The penalty values are extremely high, suggesting that either too much torque is being used, or the scaling is off. We need to reduce this term significantly.
7. **Velocity Reward**: This component is working effectively, but we can ensure it contributes further towards stability.

By optimizing the weighting and components focus, we can create a more balanced reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(self):
    env = self.env  # Do not skip this line. Afterwards, use env.{parameter_name} to access parameters of the environment.
    
    # Calculate the velocity reward based on how close the robot's base linear velocity in the x direction is to 2.0 m/s
    target_velocity = 2.0
    vel_error = torch.abs(env.base_lin_vel[:, 0] - target_velocity)
    velocity_reward = 1.0 - vel_error / target_velocity

    # Reward for maintaining torso height near 0.34 meters
    target_height = 0.34
    height_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 2] - target_height)
    height_reward = 0.5 * (1.0 - height_error / target_height)

    # Reward for maintaining orientation perpendicular to gravity
    orientation_error = torch.norm(env.projected_gravity[:, :2], dim=1)  # Should be close to zero
    orientation_reward = -0.5 * orientation_error

    # Penalty for high action rates (difference between consecutive actions)
    action_rate_penalty = 0.0001 * torch.sum(torch.abs(env.actions - env.last_actions), dim=1)

    # Penalty for DOF limit violations
    dof_pos_penalty = 0.1 * torch.sum((torch.abs(env.dof_pos - env.default_dof_pos) > 
                                      (env.dof_pos_limits[:, 1] - env.dof_pos_limits[:, 0]) * 0.5).float(), dim=1)

    # Penalty for high torques to encourage energy efficiency
    torque_penalty = 0.00001 * torch.sum(env.torques ** 2, dim=1)
    
    # Combine all reward terms
    reward = (
        3.0 * velocity_reward
        + height_reward
        + orientation_reward
        - action_rate_penalty
        - dof_pos_penalty
        - torque_penalty
    )

    # Returning individual reward components for logging/debugging purposes
    reward_components = {
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward,
        "height_reward": height_reward,
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,
        "action_rate_penalty": action_rate_penalty,
        "dof_pos_penalty": dof_pos_penalty,
        "torque_penalty": torque_penalty
    }

    return reward, reward_components
```

### Analysis of Changes:

1. **Velocity Reward**: Increased its overall contribution to `3.0` to emphasize more on achieving the target velocity.
2. **Height Reward**: Decreased its weight slightly but still retain significant control for stability.
3. **Orientation Reward**: Adjusted for finer control with `-0.5`, so it does not dominate but contributes significantly to stability.
4. **Action Rate Penalty**: Reduced significantly with a scale of `0.0001`, due to its high penalty values recorded.
5. **DOF Position Penalty**: Scaled to `0.1` for stabilizing and preserving robot kinematics, appropriate contribution.
6. **Torque Penalty**: Drastically reduced to `0.00001` because high initial penalties suggested stabilization issues.

These adjustments aim to provide better control, stability, and energy efficiency of the quadruped while meeting the target task objectives.

### Analysis of the Policy Feedback:

#### Task Score and Episode Length:
- **Task Score**: Shows a significant increase but fluctuates after training progresses. Indicates instability in the policy performance. (Max: 574.59, Mean: 333.09, Min: 0.02)
- **Episode Length**: Progressively increases indicating that the robot is learning to stay upright and into task for longer periods. (Max: 994.43, Mean: 760.26, Min: 8.00)

#### Action Rate Penalty:
- **Values**: Starts low but steadily increases indicating potentially significant and frequent changes which can be due to over-penalty.
(Mean: 2.74, Max: 4.61, Min: 0.01)
- **Action**: Reduce penalty for smoother adjustments.

#### DOF Position Penalty:
- **Values**: Steadily increases suggesting potential struggles with articulated mechanism control during prolonged execution. (Mean: 29.14, Max: 47.29, Min: 0.00)
- **Action**: Calibrate penalty impact, potentially provide more informative state or reward tuning.

#### Height Reward:
- **Values**: High and consistent within favorable range, suggesting effective control over torso height. (Mean: 295.35, Max: 397.87, Min: 2.69)
- **Action**: Increase slightly if policy deviation acceptable.

#### Orientation Reward:
- **Values**: Consistently negative, indicating detrimental effects due to current penalty structure. (Mean: -98.80, Max: -1.19, Min: -153.09)
- **Action**: Adjust to less harsh penalty scaling or reconsider approach.

#### Torque Penalty:
- **Values**: Significantly high penalties suggest potential excessively penalizing torque usage limiting learning of policy. (Mean: 3.77, Max: 5.59, Min: 0.02)
- **Action**: Further reduce penalty magnitude for smoother learning.

#### Velocity Reward:
- **Values**: Shows steady improvement, advocate decent function adherence. (Mean: 653.35, Max: 889.35, Min: 2.49)
- **Action**: Keep or enhance emphasis to encourage velocity adherence.

### Revised Reward Function Strategy:

1. **Velocity**: High emphasis on tracking velocity target more precisely.
2. **Height**: Ensure substantial support for staying on ideal height within allowed range.
3. **Orientation**: Ease the penalty scaling; introduce positive orientation stability.
4. **Action Rate Penalty**: Make smoother to prevent jittery policy.
5. **DOF Penalty**: Balance to avoid perpetual penalties of joint bounds.
6. **Torque**: Lighten penalization to suppress unnecessary hardness on policy.

### New Reward Function Code:

```python
def compute_reward(self):
    env = self.env  # Do not skip this line. Afterwards, use env.{parameter_name} to access parameters of the environment.
    
    # Calculate the velocity reward based on how close the robot's base linear velocity in the x direction is to 2.0 m/s
    target_velocity = 2.0
    vel_error = torch.abs(env.base_lin_vel[:, 0] - target_velocity)
    velocity_reward = 2.0 * (1.0 - vel_error / target_velocity)

    # Reward for maintaining torso height near 0.34 meters
    target_height = 0.34
    height_error = torch.abs(env.root_states[:, 2] - target_height)
    height_reward = 1.0 * (1.0 - height_error / target_height)

    # Reward for maintaining orientation perpendicular to gravity
    orientation_error = torch.norm(env.projected_gravity[:, :2], dim=1)  # Should be close to zero
    orientation_reward = -0.2 * orientation_error

    # Penalty for high action rates (difference between consecutive actions)
    action_rate_penalty = 0.00005 * torch.sum(torch.abs(env.actions - env.last_actions), dim=1)

    # Penalty for DOF limit violations
    dof_pos_penalty = 0.05 * torch.sum((torch.abs(env.dof_pos - env.default_dof_pos) > 
                                      (env.dof_pos_limits[:, 1] - env.dof_pos_limits[:, 0]) * 0.5).float(), dim=1)

    # Penalty for high torques to encourage energy efficiency
    torque_penalty = 0.000005 * torch.sum(env.torques ** 2, dim=1)
    
    # Combine all reward terms
    reward = (
        velocity_reward
        + height_reward
        + orientation_reward
        - action_rate_penalty
        - dof_pos_penalty
        - torque_penalty
    )

    # Returning individual reward components for logging/debugging purposes
    reward_components = {
        "velocity_reward": velocity_reward,
        "height_reward": height_reward,
        "orientation_reward": orientation_reward,
        "action_rate_penalty": action_rate_penalty,
        "dof_pos_penalty": dof_pos_penalty,
        "torque_penalty": torque_penalty
    }

    return reward, reward_components
```

### Summary:
The adjustments made should balance out the rewards and penalties, focusing on stability, efficiency, and smooth joint behavior while maintaining the target velocity, height, and orientation. Each metric is tuned to give the policy more interpretative reward space to improve upon learning and performance consistency.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the task score is always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward (tensor with reward per environment)
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component (tensor with reward component per environment)
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (2) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.

2. **DOF Position Penalty**: Fluctuations suggest a need for refinement.
3. **Height Reward**: Performing well, can continue with minor adjustment.
4. **Orientation Reward**: Too harsh, needs normalization.
5. **Torque Penalty**: High, suggesting a possible reduction.
6. **Velocity Reward**: Performing well but can be calibrated for better adherence.

### Adjustments:
1. **Action Rate Penalty**: Reduce slightly.
2. **DOF Position Penalty**: Adjust for balance.
3. **Height Reward**: Slight increase or normalization.
4. **Orientation Reward**: Soften penalty scaling.
5. **Torque Penalty**: Reduce lightly.
6. **Velocity Reward**: Enhance for improved adherence.

```
### Summary:
The adjustments made focus on balancing reward and penalty terms, specifically heightening the incentive for maintaining the target velocity and height within correct thresholds, while making the reward and penalty terms more moderate and achievable. This should ensure more stable and consistent learning by the policy.
